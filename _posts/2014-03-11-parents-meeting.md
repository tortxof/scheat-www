title: Parents' Meeting Tonight
---
The Parents' Meeting will be held tonight, March 11th, at New Beginnings from 6PM - 7PM.

Please bring the following documents:

* Birth Certificate
* Current year report card

The fee this year is $350.  We will start collecting the fee tomorrow night.
It would be great if we could get a payment of at least $100 per athlete.
We could then order the uniforms and pay for the league registration fee.

The Sponsorship Form, Athlete's Waiver, Parents' Heat Order Form, and Player information sheet
are available on the [Documents](/documents/) page.

The waiver is due tonight or no later than the first practice
(can't practice without this).

The Parents' Order & Sponsorship forms are due by April 4th.
